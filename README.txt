This is the second project I had to do, which involves server side programming as well.  In addition to HMLT5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript, I also used:    
   a.) jQuery (SPA approach, objects, closures, modules, AJAX)  
   b.) PHP (API & Routing, OO, password encryption, file upload)  
   c.) MySQL (design and create scheme, queries)
